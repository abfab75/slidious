  <h2>jQuery Slidious &ndash; Basic Example &ndash; Page 1</h2>

  <p>And by basic, I mean really, really basic. This page won't even work, if Slidious wasn't here to help.</p>
  <p>As soon as enabled, using Slidious is as simple, as defining a <a href="ajax/page-2.html">link</a>. Click it to continue.</p>
  <small>Yeah, I'm using bootstrap & centered text. I'm a programmer, dude. So don't expect too much css awesomeness.</small>
